Hi I'm Varun, an artist and computer engineer working in the fields of synthesis and interactive design.
I've been a teacher and lecturer for both hardware and software platforms as well as a graphic designer,
coder, musician and synthesizer builder. My video art projects use real-time code-based visualisations that
make use of custom built microphones, cameras and sensors.

I have 17 years of experience working in arts and culture as a promoter, label manager, and producer and 
have worked on projects in Germany, UK, USA, Poland, Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal and Nepal. 

My company Littlei has been producing concerts and festivals in Kolkata since 2007 and has been responsible for
developing new art and music traditions in the city. As a musician, composer and educator I've been
involved in trans-cultural projects and residencies and has created works that are responsive to the
technological advances of the digital age. I'm also the founder of Synthfarm, India’s leading residency for
synthesis, modular sound, music production and synth-making and the director of the Kolkata Jazzfest, one
of India's longest running music festivals.

I publish my work on the internet under the moniker Varundo with my Facebook 3D depth-map work
going viral gathering 750,000+ followers. As an early adopter of NFTs, I've been using the technology to
create interactive and generative work while leading educational programs and digital exhibitions for artists
across India.

My art practice involves creating immersive installations that use code and sound as primary tools. In
2018 I created a 3 room sound installation at Goa’s Serendipity Arts Festival using hand built
electromagnetic microphones. In 2021 I presented my first solo show at Experimenter - Hindustan Road which
showcased 3 works driven by self built hardware and software. In 2023 I was a digital artist in residence
at India Art Fair in collaboration with Apple, where I showcased an immersive room installation that was
created on the iPad Pro.
